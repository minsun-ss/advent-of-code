# AOC 2017

Hitting up Recurse Fall 2025 with a new AOC!

# Some thoughts

I finished all of 2017 during the Fall 2025 Recurse batch and Winter 1 2025. Similar to 2024, in python I tried never to really reach for imports at all. Outside of Day 23 Part 2 (was really well and truly stumped about going about this in a programmatic way), the rest were relatively simple? I don't think I had any major trouble with any of the problems, but how much of this is a reflection of how much AoC I've done vs how much of a better programmer I've become at identifying problems, I'm not sure.

I did learn some new tricks in python, though! Doing turn rotations via complex numbers or vector multiplication.

For this particular batch of problems, though, I learned a smidge of two new languages to solve problems: Haskell, and Zig. I am not very sure on Zig, but I am finding Haskell interesting enough to maybe consider working 2025 in.
