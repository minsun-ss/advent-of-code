# AOC 2025

Echoing what I said in 2024, every year I want to do this in a different language from python and get pretty lazy about it. 

# Some thoughts

Maybe it was because I had just come off from finishing all of 2017 before 2025, but found puzzles 1-6 pretty easy; 7 and 8 posed more of a challenge, but not significantly more. I think doing AOC is a bit like doing crosswords; you do them often enough and you get a sixth sense after a while whether or not you're on the right track. I'm usually pretty sure when I have the correct answer even if I don't have that same certainty about the algo I'm using; it's just a feeling.
